Check-Host is a modern online tool for website monitoring and checking availability of hosts, DNS records, IP addresses. It supports the latest technologies such as localized domain names (both punycode and original formats), hostname IPv6 records (also known as AAAA record).

Info is useful to check IP and hostname location: IP range, ISP, organization, country, region, city, ZIP/postal code, time zone and local time. Find out what is known about your host.

Ping allows you to test the reachability of a host and to measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer.

HTTP was created for website monitoring and checking performance and availability of any URLs from many countries and datacenters. Allows you to monitor response time from different locations.

TCP port checks the possibility of a TCP connection to host's specified port from different locations around the world. To check the possibility of a UDP connection use the UDP port check.

DNS retrieves info about hostname or IP from nameservers around the world. You could easily monitor and check updates of DNS records with this service.

Bookmarklet allows you to perform checks of websites easlier. Save bookmarklet in your bookmarks and use anytime it you need.
